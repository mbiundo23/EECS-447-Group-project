# Introduction

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a database to cover the borrowing and management of media items in a small library. The database will track items such as books, eBooks, audiobooks, magazines, and digital disks, including their availability and borrowing status. The database also tracks the borrowing of electronics, tools and printers and room reservations.

## Scope

The purpose of the database is to track the media items in the library; Who has a given item checked out, is it available still, etc. This is not related to higher-level administration (budgeting, payroll, etc.). Items that can be borrowed are Resources, each with their own unique ResourceID.
