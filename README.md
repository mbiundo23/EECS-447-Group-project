# Team organization and profiles
_Define the team organization and team member profiles. Assign roles for the team members, and designate one member as the team administrator.
Team member profiles should include: names, contact information, availability, computing platform experience, and programming language knowledge. Adding photos is recommended for future reference._

# Weekly meetings
_Decide on weekly meeting details: Provide the location, schedule, and methods for task allocation and tracking.
Note: Each team member must contribute to the project and complete assigned tasks. Regular attendance at team meetings is mandatory.
Communication and collaboration are essential for project success. Adhere to project deadlines and guidelines._

Location: Anshuctz Library

Schedule: Thursday and Friday nights @ 7pm - TBD. 

Methods for task allocation and tracking: 

  One method for task allocation and tracking would be a shared excel spreadsheet with hours logged and assigned tasks completed. This would be a dynamic spreadsheet as to where when changes are made, team members are notified. 
  
  Another method for task allocation would be to use already widely use applications such as Microsoft Teams or other platforms that allow for team communication.
