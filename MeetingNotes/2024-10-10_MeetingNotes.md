## Meeting Contents

Karsten noted before the meeting started that he would have to leave at about 6:20 pm.

Max is going to create the ER diagram itself.

Samuel will copy some information from past Project Parts into Part 3, where applicable.

Over the course of the coming week, team members will add details they think are relevant to Part 3. We will meet again next Thursday (2024-10-17) to finalize details before Max creates the ER diagram.

Once this was decided on, we ended the meeting at 6:17 pm.
